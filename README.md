Ever wondered what would be the probability of this happening? We have calculated it! Yes right. The probability of this happening is 0.58%. We simulated the IPL match scheduling environment 1M times and came up with this result. Have a look at the given code to understand how we came up with this number.

PS: We also wanted to calculate exact probability by actually solving the sum in traditional mathematical style, we tried but thought it would be very difficult. Anyone up for this challenge contact [@adwaitbhope](https://github.com/adwaitbhope) or me.
